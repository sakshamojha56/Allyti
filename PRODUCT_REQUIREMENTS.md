## Product Requirements Document & Technical Architecture

---

## 1. Vision and Key Differentiators

### Core Mission
Allyti bridges the gap between professional networking and authentic community discourse for India's premier technical and management institutions. By combining LinkedIn-style professional networking with Reddit-style anonymous discussions, we create a unique ecosystem where IIT/IIM students and alumni can:

- **Build and maintain professional relationships** while preserving access to honest, unfiltered community discussions
- **Share career opportunities and insights** alongside real experiences and challenges
- **Maintain institutional pride and connections** while fostering genuine peer support

### Value Proposition
- **Dual Identity Management**: Seamlessly switch between verified professional identity and anonymous community participation
- **Institutional Trust**: Verified IIT/IIM membership creates higher trust and relevance than generic platforms
- **Contextual Networking**: Connect with peers who share similar academic rigor, career paths, and cultural understanding
- **Safe Space for Real Talk**: Anonymous section allows honest discussions about mental health, career struggles, placement experiences, and institutional challenges

### Key Differentiators
1. **Verified Academic Pedigree**: Strong verification process ensures community quality and relevance
2. **Intelligent Privacy Boundary**: Clear separation between professional and anonymous identities with zero cross-contamination
3. **Institution-Specific Context**: Features and discussions tailored to IIT/IIM-specific experiences (placements, campus life, alumni networks)
4. **Cultural Relevance**: Built for Indian academic and professional culture with features like batch-mate connections, coding rounds discussions, CAT prep communities

### Balancing Professionalism and Anonymity
- **Clear Visual Distinction**: Different UI themes and interfaces for each section
- **Separate Notification Systems**: Professional notifications during work hours, community notifications based on user preferences
- **Zero Data Leakage**: Technical architecture ensures anonymous posts cannot be traced to professional profiles
- **Community Guidelines**: Section-specific rules that maintain professionalism in one and encourage authentic discourse in the other
